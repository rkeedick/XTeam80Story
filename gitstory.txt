	Johnny Appleseed was strolling through his apple orchard one beautiful early-autumn morning.  The sun was beginning to shine itself over the mountains to the east and the many birdsongs sung welcomed its comforting and energizing light.  As he walked along, Johnny looked up at what appeared to be the most beautiful apple he had ever seen.  It was unbelievably red, glistening from the morning dew, tempting one to reach up and grab it.  Enthralled, Johnny stretched out his arm to pluck this delicious specimen from the tree before him.  And as his hand neared its target, the branch of the tree wrapped itself around Johnny Appleseed's arm and whipped him up into its canopy.
	After Johnny regained his conscious, he found himself in the greatest grassland he's ever seen. Its domain stretched to the distant horizon, and between this sea of greenness and the bluest sky, there was Johnny and a rabbit.
	Still dazed, Johnny shifted his gaze from the endless sea of grass to the fluffy white rabbit. "Follow me!" the bunny squealed. "I will show you everything." 
	Bunny started running, and Johnny quickly following the bunny to a different place.
	They ran and they ran through the vast, endless meadow.  It all seemed quite unreal.  The unreality of the situation increased with each passing moment.  The sky turned red, then pink, before settling on a dark and magical purple.  Then, thick black clouds filled the sky and paradise turned to hellscape.  The bunny began to chuckle, and then that chuckle escalated to a cackle and finally to an uproar.  With the sound of the rabbit's demented laughter filling his head and driving him mad, Johnny woke to find himself in the very orchard he had been before being abducted by that evil tree.
