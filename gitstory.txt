	Johnny Appleseed was strolling through his apple orchard one beautiful early-autumn morning.  The sun was beginning to shine itself over the mountains to the east and the many birdsongs sung welcomed its comforting and energizing light.  As he walked along, Johnny looked up at what appeared to be the most beautiful apple he had ever seen.  It was unbelievably red, glistening from the morning dew, tempting one to reach up and grab it.  Enthralled, Johnny stretched out his arm to pluck this delicious specimen from the tree before him.  And as his hand neared its target, the branch of the tree wrapped itself around Johnny Appleseed's arm and whipped him up into its canopy.
